See README-example.md in the examples directory for ideas on what we are looking for.

## Artist Statement

Describe what you were trying to make: I am attempting to make a "town" with multiple objects, some moving some not.

## Straightforward Checks

Please list how your assignment fills the requirements. In cases where you have more than the requirements (e.g., 2,3,5,6) just list the most interesting ones. A short description (a few words) is probably sufficient. Leave blank or say "N/A" for things you didn't do.

Note: the other checks we can see easily.

2. 2 different kinds of objects that you made (just list 2)
    1. Skyscraper
    2. Train

3.  5 different kinds of objects beyond #2. (just list 5)
    1. UFO
    2. Road
    3. Houses
    4. Trees
    5. Car

5. 3 different behaviors. (just list 3)
    1. Train (bezier)
    2. Car (driving)
    3. UFO (spinning in air)

6. At least 3 objects must be "rideable"
    1. Truck
    2. Train
    3. UFO

7. "train track" with a "train" (tell us how we know its a spline)
    1. In train.js, you can see the use of Bezier Curves to build the track and train path.

8. One object from each category
    - buildings: houses/skyscrapers
    - natural elements: trees
    - vehicles: car/train

9. There is at least one model loaded from a file. (e.g. loading a `.obj` or `.fbx` file)
    1. Horses on carousel from: https://clara.io/view/92450e99-0142-4ea5-9e0d-9c4960f2fb31

10. There is at least one shader that you wrote.
    - what object is it on: the sand pit
    - describe: uses a shader to add a texture to the sand
    - filename: ./for_students/shaders/sand.fs, ./for_students/shaders/sand.vs
    - texture was from: https://www.deviantart.com/hhh316/art/Seamless-desert-sand-texture-183159331 

12. SkyBox or some other texture (list one - and say why you didn't have skybox if you don't have one)
    1. The Skybox was from: http://www.humus.name/index.php?page=Textures&start=112 

## Complexity Points

Describe each thing that you did that you think is worth complexity points.

n/a

If possible, order them from most interesting to least interesting.

Describe what the thing is, where we can see it, and why it deserves complexity points.

Note: put "####" (4 hash marks) and number the complex things to make it easier for us to identify them, but put the description on a separate line. We've given you the first 2 headers

#### Complex Thing 1:

#### Complex Thing 2:

## Screenshots

List the pictures that you made with a brief description
